# nvim-config

My neovim configuration files. Just clone this repo into `~/.config/nvim` and run `:PackerInstall` on first launch to install required plugins.

Thanks to @nullishamy for providing her base configuration for me to customize - you can see her configuration [here](https://github.com/nullishamy/nvim-config).
